Python 2.2.1 documentation in Dash format
=========================================

The Jython implementation shipped with WebLogic and WebSphere is stuck at 2.2.1, so 
if you have to work with it, it's nice to have this particular documentation in Dash.

The package is generated by a script, so occasional errors might appear.
